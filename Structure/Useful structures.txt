✅ Most Useful → Least Useful (According to Your Table & Practice)
🔝 Tier 1 — Core / Essential (High payoff, very frequent)

These should come first and get the most repetition.

Present Simple

(“I like pizza.” / “Do you work here?”)

Habits, facts, identity, preferences

Backbone of communication

Present Continuous

(“I’m studying now.”)

Actions happening now, temporary situations

Extremely natural in conversation

Past Simple

(“I went home.” / “Did you eat?”)

Storytelling, daily reports, real-life narration

🟡 Tier 2 — Very Useful (Frequent, but comes after the basics)

Future (will / going to) – Simple

(“I will call you.” / “I’m going to travel.”)

Plans, decisions, promises

Essential for real-world use

Present Perfect

(“I’ve eaten.” / “Have you been there?”)

Life experience, recent actions

Tricky conceptually, but very common

🟢 Tier 3 — Useful but Situational (Lower frequency)

Past Continuous

(“I was working when…”)

Background actions, interruptions

Useful for narration, but not urgent early

Future Continuous

(“I’ll be working tomorrow.”)

Polite or contextual future

More stylistic than necessary

⚠️ Tier 4 — Rare / Advanced / Low ROI

Past Perfect

(“I had already left.”)

Mostly used for sequencing in stories

Rare in spontaneous beginner speech

Present Perfect Continuous

(“I’ve been studying all day.”)

Very specific meaning

Nice to understand, not urgent to produce
